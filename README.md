Terminal emulator in racket!

Very much a work in progress, started as a project to learn Racket, though I hope it grows beyond that to be one I can use as my daily driver.  Therefore there are various design goals for... some day.

It is not yet really packaged or anything.  To run the xterm, run `racket xterm.rkt`.

It has many issues, but you can run vim on it.

For now, use `TERM=linux` to not get a bunch of xterm garbage that it doesn't handle yet.
